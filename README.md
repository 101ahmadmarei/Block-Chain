# FundMeOK
An Ethereum-based crowdfunding platform

## Description
### What?

FundMeOK is a crowdfunding platform based on blockchain technologies. It allows people to solicit funds for an idea, charity, or start-up business. It is fully decentralized, secured, and trust worthy.

### Why?

There are so many crowdfunding scams on the internet nowadays. Backers have no controls on how the funds are used once they contribute to a project. We aim to solve the problems of existing crowdfunding platforms to make sure funds are used properly for project success and gain trust between manager and backers.

### How?

FundMeOK is built on top of Ethereum platform. FundMe smart contract will be deployed on Ethereum nodes. A web app will be built for user to interact with the FundMe smart contract using web3.js interface in the backend. The framework and tools we expect to use are:

Front End
* HTML, LESS (or SASS)/CSS
* JavaScript, React/React Native

Back end
* NodeJS
* Web3.js
* IPFS

Tools
* Remix, Infura, Truffle
* Visual Studio Code, Git/GitHub
* Trello

Miscellaneous
* Ganache CLI, MetaMask
