# Academic Chain

## Description
### What?
Academic Chain is an application designed to store and retrieve academic records for use in academic institutions. It allows faculty to append student and class information to a blockchain structure and allows for the retrieve this data or collect statistics about certain classes or student groups. 

### Why?
There are rarely cases where academic records need to be removed from a database. Because of this, a blockchain structure is perfect to store records of this type. Faculty can append information indefinitely and the record can follow students easily as they make their way through academiaâ€™s ranks. A record of this type would be useful for transfer students, or to corporations looking to vet new employees. 

### How?
A blockchain structure will be appended to as students complete their courses. A user interface will allow these students and faculty to search for data in these records and manipulate them. Some frameworks/libraries we plan to use are:
