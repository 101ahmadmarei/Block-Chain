# AcademicChain
An academic records storage utility

## Description
### What?

AcademicChain is a record keeping utility and storage. It allows an authority to append student and class information to an immutable blockchain ledger. This allows students and faculty to view these records like a transcript, but also lets one pull useful statistics from the data such as overall GPA, class average, and popularity of a class.

### Why?

The system of academic transcripts today leaves a lot to be desired. They are unintuitive, difficult to manage and cost money to do trivial things such as transfer data. AcademicChain aims to solve that by createing a blockchain-like structure to store transcript information that also allows one to generate other data such as class average and class GPA.

### How?

FundMeOK is built on top of Ethereum platform. FundMe smart contract will be deployed on Ethereum nodes. A web app will be built for user to interact with the FundMe smart contract using web3.js interface in the backend. The framework and tools we expect to use are:

Front End
* Qt5, PySide2 python bindings

Back end
* Python3

Tools
* Visual Studio Code
* Git/GitHub

## Deliverables
### TODO
1.	Web app
* Project manager can create new campaigns
* Project manager can create spending requests
* Project manager can finalize requests
* Backer can contribute to a campaign
* Backer can approve spending requests
*	…
2.	Backend
*	Set of APIs to interact with FundMe smart contract
    * createNewCampaign
