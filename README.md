What?
Academic Chain is an application designed to store and retrieve academic records for use in academic institutions. It allows faculty to append student and class information to a blockchain structure and allows for the retrieve this data or collect statistics about certain classes or student groups. 

Why?
There are rarely cases where academic records need to be removed from a database. Because of this, a blockchain structure is perfect to store records of this type. Faculty can append information indefinitely and the record can follow students easily as they make their way through academiaâ€™s ranks. A record of this type would be useful for transfer students, or to corporations looking to vet new employees. 

How?
A blockchain structure will be appended to as students complete their courses. A user interface will allow these students and faculty to search for data in these records and manipulate them. Some frameworks/libraries we plan to use are:

Front end
Qt5
PySide2

Back end
Python3

Tools
Git
